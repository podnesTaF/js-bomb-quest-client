js quest:

make the bomb flash. just idea

Idea:
1) Create app with modules and questions, Hints, errors, answers, progress etc.
2) Questions on four topics:
- js event loop
- react hooks basics
- typescript
- promises
3) each module has 10 - 12 different questions with several type of introduction the problem
- just question and answer
- drag and drop (event loop, etc)
- code and multiple quest
- write the result one by one (event loop)
- etc.
4) Hints after wrong question, explaining right one; and little hint clicking on the i icon in the right top corner
5) congradulation component after finish test with analyze of answers and correct one, if guy didn't answer more than 50% of quest, make him redo, if it isn't the case, go on the main page with modules, unlock next module.
6) After levels finished bomb explode with a message: "It's crime to know js so good".

side notes:

- It's shouldn't be a problem to add another module just adding it to database;

- first make it without user, than add it with profile and weak points.

- recommendations page with good react, js, ts content

- review module
